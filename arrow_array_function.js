// Back to the two gymnastics teams, the Dolphins and the Koalas! There is a new gymnastics discipline, which works differently.
// Each team competes 3 times, and then the average of the 3 scores is calculated (so one average score per team).
// A team only wins if it has at least double the average score of the other team. Otherwise, no team wins!


// Your tasks:
// Create an arrow function calcAverage to calculate the average of 3 scores. 
// This function should have three parameters and return a single number (the average score).

// Create two new variables â€” scoreDolphins and scoreKoalas, 
// and assign the value returned from the calcAverage function to them (you will need to call this function, and pass scores as arguments).

// Create a function checkWinner that takes the average score of each team as parameters (avgDolphins and avgKoalas), 
// and then logs the winner to the console, together with the victory points, according to the rule above. 
// Example: Koalas win (30 vs. 13) (use avgDolphins and avgKoalas instead of hard-coded values).

// Use the checkWinner function to determine the winner for both DATA 1 and DATA 2.
// Ignore draws this time. Instead, log No team wins... to the console if there is no winner.


// TEST DATA 1: Dolphins scored 44, 23, and 71. Koalas scored 65, 54, and 49.
// TEST DATA 2: Dolphins scored 85, 54, and 41. Koalas scored 23, 34, and 27.

const calcAverage = (a, b, c) => (a + b + c)/3
const scoreDolphins = calcAverage(85,54,41)
const scoreKoalas = calcAverage(23,34,27)

const checkWinner = (avgDolphins, avgKoalas) => {
    if (avgDolphins >= avgKoalas * 2){
        console.log(`Dolphins win (${avgDolphins} vs ${avgKoalas})`)
    } 
    else if (avgKoalas >= avgDolphins * 2) {
        console.log(`Koalas win (${avgKoalas} vs ${avgDolphins})`)
    } else {
        console.log('No team wins...')
    }
}

//case1: arrow function as a method
const jonas = {
    firstName: 'Jonas',
    year: 1991,
    calcAge: function() {
        console.log(2025 - this.year) 
    },
    //using this in arrow function/ the function will look for this in the global scope (window object). 
    // since there's no firstName varible in the global scope, it'll be undefined.   
    // greet: () => {console.log(`Hey ${this.firstName}`)}

    //solution -> use normal function that allows this keyword
    greet: function() {
        console.log(`Hey ${this.firstName}`)
    }
}
